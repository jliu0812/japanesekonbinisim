#  Japanese Konbini (Convenience Store) Simulator

## Backstory
One time in Japan, I was buying something from a convenience store. The cashier told me: 三百五十九円になります。
I misheard and gave the wrong change, and I suffered from embarrassment. :sad:
That's what motivated me to make this app, it's to train my Japanese number hearing skills.

## Notes
* This is my first SwiftUI App, be gentle.

## Future Improvements
* Dark Mode
* Timer functionality. Also, present a nice graph when asked for by the user.
* Some unit tests to ensure app doesn't break with every new feature.
